# project_landingpage
This repository is intended for a project (Landing Page) based off of The Odin Project

Within the project I utilized HTML5 and CSS3. In CSS3 I used flexbox, margins, and padding to position my elements. Then with HTML I used sections, navigation, and footer to separate my content. Finally, I used classes to choose more specific elements when using CSS3.

For comparison, if you look in the images folder you can see which picture I used to create my copy in HTML and CSS.
